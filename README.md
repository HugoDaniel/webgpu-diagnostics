# WebGPU Diagnostics

The app collects runtime diagnostics for the active WebGPU adapter and device,
then draws a triangle generated through the compute pipeline. You can adjust
shader complexity with the sidebar sliders, inspect the live WGSL output, and
monitor timing numbers for pipeline and shader compilation.

Use it to confirm WebGPU support in different browsers, compare limits between
machines, or reproduce driver issues without building a full project.
